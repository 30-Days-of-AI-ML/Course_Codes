# DAY 1 LEARNING : 

In Day 1 we covered the concepts : 

1.) Python - Introduction , Why Python for ML 

    * High Speed Computation
    
    * Package Support 
    
    * Support to frameworks

2.) Python basics - Variables , Functions & Loops ,Conditional Statements

3.) Foundadtion of Computational Mathematics for ML & Data science

4.) Real Life Examples 

5.) Learnt Python Packages - 
    
    * Sympy - For mathematical computations - https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html
    * gTTS  - For text to speech and viceversa - https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/
    * Playsound - For sound playing - https://pypi.org/project/playsound/
    
## How to start with Codes : 

1.) All Class codes are uploaded in this Repo /Day-1 , kindly follow and run in your Local OS 

2.) We Have implemented some computational codes today as well one short project thats also there.

3.) If you want to create a virtual env in Anaconda to use pip command follow this : 
```
Open Anaconda prompt 
conda create --name pip_env
conda  install pip 
pip install gTTs
```
4.) If you want to install any Library in Anaconda , follow : 
```
Open Anaconda Prompt 
conda install [library-name]
```
5.) If you want to Learn the libraries , link provided above 

6.) For rest logics refer class video
